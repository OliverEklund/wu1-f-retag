            <h1>The Future of AI in the military</h1>
            <p>Our main goal is to spearhead the research into automated AI systems for usage in the military and defense industry. We pride ourselves in our advanced tech and research.</p>
            <h3>Take a look at our portfolio of advanced products</h3>

                            <h3>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</h3>
                            <p>UAVs are our current main focus, Our research in this field is aimed mostly at creating the perfect independent UAV AI. Our goal is to create an artificial pilot capable of outperforming highly skilled human pilot while also being affordable.</p>
                            <p>Our company's UAVs have a history of perfectly executing missions. Our most prominent model is the MX-28 GhostCat. A small but highly capable air to ground attack aircraft with a rich performance history on many fronts.</p>

                            <p>We at Aerosphere-Innovations have been making AI controlled targeting systems ever since the company's conception. Our systems can be found on several things such as scopes, in vehicles, on planes, ships all the way to autonomous systems and satellites.</p>
                            <p>The targeting systems range is a large and varied one with lots of history behind it.</p>

                            <p>A rather new field we at Aerosphere-Innovations have started in. We plan to give individual soldiers their own portable AI systems which will be capable of targeting, analysing situations and much more.</p>
